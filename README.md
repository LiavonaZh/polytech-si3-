## Polytech Nice-Sophia SI3 Semestre 6 ADS Labs

### Package graph
This package contains classes for efficient work with the graphs:
1. Directed/undirected graph
2. Weighted directed/undirected graph

### Package 'heap'
'heap' contains the implementation of the heap (used also in semestre 5)


### lab6
In lab6 there are essential sorting (Heap sort, merge sort, quick sort)
To test sortings, run the main funtion in TestSort class

### lab7
In lab7 Disjoint set is implemented. To test it, run main() in TestDisjointSets class.
Also, it can create a Maze with Disjoint Sets. For this, run main() in Maze and set
the size of wished maze.

### lab8
(to finish)

### lab9
Implementing Topological Sort
Run main() in TopSort class

### lab10
Implements Kruskal and Prim algos for to find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Mininun Spanning Forest (with several graphs)

### lab11
Implements Dijkstra algorithm to find the minimum cost from one vertex to all the others.
Functions with directed and undirected graphs.
